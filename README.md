This project was developed as part of a university course project.
It is a client-server application for managing and selling digital paintings and artworks.
The main goal of the project was to demonstrate practical knowledge of network communication, multi-threading, and database interaction within a client-server architecture.
The server manages the art collection, user authentication, and purchase requests, while the client allows users to browse, search, and buy artworks.
